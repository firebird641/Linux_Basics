# Linux Documentation

by firebird641

## Nano

Nano is a simple Linux Console Text / Script Editor. Run it using the **nano** command.

## Cat

**cat** stands for concatenate
cat takes files, concatenates them and prints their content.
Common use for cat is to print a single file to the terminal.

~~~bash
cat file.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt
~~~

## Printf

printf prints out a formatted string in which you can put variables and escape sequences.

~~~bash
printf "Hi, I'm %s.\n" $NAME
~~~

## List Files

~~~bash
ls # show files in current directory
ls -l # list files in current directory
ls -la # list all files in current directory
ls -lah # list all files in current directory with human readable sizes
~~~

## Copy, Move, Rename and Delete

~~~bash
# Copy
cp file1 file2
# Rename / Move
mv file1 file2
# Delete
rm file
rm -r directory # recursively remove
rmdir # removes a directory
~~~

## fsck

This verifies a file system (like checkdisk). 

## pwd

Print Working Directory prints the current directory path.

## Directory Structure Commands

~~~bash
/ # root directory
~ # current users home directory
./ # current directory
../ # parent directory
~~~

## Change Directory

~~~bash
cd /home/user/ # go to /home/user/
~~~

## Chroot

Chroot allowes you to change the root directory. This means you can set up a folder as a virtual environment for example (this is used when installing Arch Linux). To run commands inside the chroot directory you need to have all necessary files inside the jail. You can also run commands in a chroot:

~~~
chroot /home/user/directory command
~~~

## Fakeroot

Fakeroot creates a environment that simulates root privileges on a command. It fooles the command process that it runs as root.

## File Extensions

Linux does not know any file extensions. It determines the type of a file by the file header. Use whatever you want.

## Special Chaining Operators

~~~bash
apt update & apt dist-upgrade -y & # Backgrounds the Update commands
sleep 10 ; wall "Hello World" # send Message "Hello World" to all users after 10 Seconds
rm -rf !(*.html) # delete all files except *.html
~~~

## Autocomplete

When typing a command you can press the TAB-Key to let the system automatically complete your input if possible.

## Console Shortcuts

There are 6 tty Consoles on any Linux System. If it runs run a Desktop Manager, it is on the 7th Console. You can Access the Consoles with the Keyboard Shortcut:

~~~bash
Strg + Alt + F1-F7
~~~

## APT

APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a Linux Package Manager. It is used to Install / Remove / Update Software Packages for Debian-based Distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint and others.

~~~bash
apt update # Update Software List (check for updates)
apt dist-upgrade # Update Software based on Software List
apt install gimp # Install Package "GIMP"
apt search python # Search for Package "python"
apt remove firefox # Remove the Package "Firefox"
apt autoremove # Remove unnecessary Packages automatically
apt -f install # Install unmet dependencies
dpkg --configure -a # Complete Update/Upgrade Process if it has been interrupted
dpkg -i package.deb # Install the Debian Package "package.deb"
~~~

## Services

Services can be configured using the service command.

~~~bash
service --status-all # show status of all services
service networking restart # restart network service
service gdm start # start service gdm
service ssh stop # stop SSH service
~~~

## Networking

Here are some useful networking commands:

~~~bash
ifconfig -a # Show Status of all Interfaces
ip link # show all Network Interfaces
ip addr # Show interface IP/MAC-Addresses
netstat -tulpn # show Services listening on TCP/UDP Ports
nslookup google.com # resolve Google.com using the systems DNS Server
traceroute google.com # do a traceroute on google.com
~~~

The Network Interfaces can be configured in the **/etc/network/interfaces** file.

~~~bash
# DHCP Interface Example
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
# Static Interface  Example
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
	address 192.168.0.1
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.0.1
	dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1
~~~

## Script Execution

When writing a script you want to execute with the console (./script), you need to specify the program that is being used to run the script. The following example is the first line of a python script.

~~~bash
#!/usr/bin/python
~~~

## mkpasswd

~~~bash
mkpasswd -l 16 # generates a passwort of length 16
~~~

## Checking Disk Usage

~~~bash
df # Disk Free: shows free disk space
du # Disk Usage: shows the used disk space
~~~

## iptables

iptables is a low-Level IP-Filtering Firewall.

## arptables

arptables is a low-Level ARP-Filtering Firewall.

## dd

The disk dump command allowes you to create images from block devices or write images to block devices.

~~~bash
dd if=source of=target # clones from source to target
~~~

## sync

Sync writes any data buffered in memory to the disk. Useful if there is an unexpected halt of the system or before removing an external data stroage medium.

## I/O Redirection

### Stream Numbers
0: STDIN is the standard Input

1: STDOUT is the standard Output

2: STDERR is the standard Error
### Redirection
~~~bash
command 2> error.log # Redirects Error Output to error.log
command &> file.log # Redirects Output and Error to file.log
command > file.log 2>&1 # same as above
command 2>&1 # Redirects STDERR to STDOUT
command 2> errors.txt 1> output.txt # Redirects Error and Output to different files
command < file.txt # Redirects the default input STDIN to command
command << file.txt # Redirects the input from file to STDIN sequencially
command1 | command2 # Redirects output of command1 to command2
~~~
## Tee
This command allows you to write command output to a file and also redirect it to the STDOUT. Normally it is being used in a pipe.
~~~bash
command1 | tee output.txt | command2
~~~
## grep

grep looks for text.

~~~bash
cat text.txt | grep Hello # search for "Hello"
grep -v Hello ./text.txt # prints all lines that do not contain "Hello"
~~~

## locate

Very fast method to find files by their name. It uses a Search Database called mlocate.

~~~bash
locate file.txt # prints out all paths to files calles "file.txt"
locate -c file.txt # prints the number of results
sudo updatedb # updates the search database (mlocate)
~~~

## su

Substitute user changes the current user (default: root).

## who

Tells you who is logged in.

## Lists

~~~bash
command ./{element1,element2,element3}
~~~
## Less

The less command shows the content of a file from the beginning.

## Echo

Echo allowes you to print Strings to the STDOUT. You can combine it with Pipes and pass it to other files.

~~~bash
echo "Hello World."
~~~

## Wall

Wall (Write All) sends a message to all users.

~~~bash
wall "Hello. System Shutdown in 30 seconds." ; shutdown -h -t 30
~~~

## File Permissions

### Users and Groups
Users have a name and a UID, unique ID.

Groups consist of multiple users and also have a name and a GID, group ID.
### Attribute String
~~~bash
d rwx r-x ---
1 2   3   4

# 1: Type
# 2: User
# 3: Group
# 4: Everyone
~~~
#### First Element (1 Character)
d = Directory

b = Block Device

c = Character Device

s = Socket

f = Pipeline

\- = File
#### Second to Fourth Element (3 Characters each)
r = Read Permission

w = Write Permission

x = Execution Permission

\- = No Right
### Octal Numbers
~~~bash
4 = Read
2 = Write
1 = Execute
0 = No Rights
~~~
All numbers added together define the permission for a file or folder.
### Examples
~~~bash
# No Rights: 0 / ---
# Executable: 1 / --x
# Writeable: 2 / -w-
# Readable: 4 / r--
# Executable + Writeable: 3 / -wx
# Executable + Readable: 5 / r-x
# Readable + Writeable: 6 / rw-
# Readable + Writeable + Executable: 7 rwx
~~~
### Special Rights
setUID: Run executable with the rights of the owner, not the one who is executing it (Octal 4).

setGID: Run executable with rights of the group, not the one of the executing group (Octal 2).

stickyBit: Only owner of the file can remove or rename the file (Octal 1).

## chmod

Change Mode sets the file permissions for a file or directory.

~~~bash
chmod +x file.sh # make file.sh executable
~~~

## chown

Change Owner sets the owner of a file or directory.

## Boot Process

### Simplified Boot Process 

- BIOS runs the Bootloader
- Bootloader loads Kernel into Memory and starts it
- Kernel initializes services and drivers
- Kernel mounts / (root filesystem)
- Kernel starts **init** Program (PID 1)
- **init** starts Rest of System Processes

### Kernel Initialization

- CPU Inspection
- Memory Inspection
- Device Bus and Device Discovery
- Auxiliary Kernel Subsystem Setup
- Mount Root FS
- Start Userspace

## GRUB Bootloader

GRUB = Grand Unified Bootloader

Press "e" to view the Bootloader Config for the current Boot Option.

### GRUB Command Line

Startup: Press C inside the Boot Menu.

~~~bash
ls # list Devices
ls -l # more detailed device list
echo $root # determine GRUB root
ls ($root)/boot # go to /boot directory
set # view all current GRUB variables
~~~

### GRUB Configuration

File Path: /boot/grub/grub.cfg

**Do not edit grub.cfg directly! Use grub-mkconfig.**

/etc/grub.d provides shell scripts for grub-mkconfig.

~~~bash
grub-mkconfig # prints the configuration to the stdout
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg # same as above but writes it to grub.cfg
~~~

### GRUB Installation

~~~bash
grub-install /dev/sda # install to /boot/grub
grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sdc # install to /mnt/boot
~~~

## Userspace Basics

### Intro to init

init is the first process of a linux system to start, with PID = 1. It executes all other processes.

Init Implementations:

- System V init: Traditional old version
- systemd: Standard for most distros
- Upstart: Ubuntu init (prior v15.04)

### Runlevels

Runlevels control the execution of Processes and Daemons.

~~~bash
0: Shutdown. Dismount Partitions. Close Network Connections.
1: Single-User Runlevel. Only Hard Drives and Filesystems are active.
2: Single-User Mode. No Network. Only local Resources.
3: Local Multi-User Mode. Network Init (Debian). Local Resources.
4: Not defined.
5: Graphical User Interface is starting.
6: Reboot. Close Network Connections. Dismount Partitions.
~~~

### Changing Runlevels

~~~bash
init <runlevel> # = 1-6
~~~

### systemd

Systemd Startup:

- systemd loads config
- systemd determines boot goal (default.target)
- systemd loads boot goal dependencies
- systemd activates dependencies and default.target

### Units and Unit Types

A unit type is a systemd capability, like for example mounting Filesystems, Monitor Network Sockets, Run Timers. There are different Unit Types:

- Service Units (control daemons)
- Mount Units (control filesystem attachments)
- Target Units (control other Units)

## passwd

Changes the password for the specified user.

## whatis

Informs you about what a specified command does.

## sudo

sudo allows you to run commands as root.

~~~bash
sudo passwd -d root # disable root login
~~~

Examples for /etc/sudoers:

~~~bash
root ALL = (ALL) ALL # Root may execute all commands with sudo
%administrator ALL = (ALL) ALL #  Group administrator my execute all commands with sudo
admin ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL # user admin may execute all programs without password input
user ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python # user may execute /usr/bin/python without password input
~~~

## cmp

Compares two files and outputs all differences.

## ftp

File Transfer Protocol Tool.

## curl

Allows you to transfer files from or to a server. It supports a wide range of network protocols: HTTP, FTP, HTTPS, LDAP, TELNET and others.

Example usage:

~~~bash
curl https://debian.org # get the main Debian webpage
curl http://10.10.0.123:8080 # get Ip 10.10.0.123 Port 8080
curl -o thatpage.html http://www.netscape.com # Store the web page to thatpage.html
curl -O www.haxx.se/index.html -O curl.haxx.se/download.html # fetch two files and store them with their remote name
curl -u name:passwd ftp://machine.domain:port/full/path/to/file # Download File from FTP Server with username and password
~~~

## Environment Variables

Environment Variables are Variables accessible by any shell and can for example define paths to executables or proxy configurations. They are different from Shell Variables.

Important commands:

~~~bash
KEY=value1:value2:value3 # Three values in one variable
KEY="value with spaces" # One String (with spaces) in a variable
env # print all set environment variables
echo $TEST_VAR # output value of TEST_VAR
export TEST_VAR # Convert Shell Variable into Environment Variable
export NEW_VAR="Testing export" # Set NEW_VAR as Environment Variable
export -n TEST_VAR # Convert Environment Variable to Shell Variable
unset TEST_VAR # Remove Shell Variable
~~~

## Killing Processes

You can either kill a process by it's UID (Unique Identifier) or by it's name:

~~~bash
kill 1234 # kill Process with ID 1234
kill -SIGTERM 3139 # kill Process 3139 with SIGNTERM
killall python # kill python
~~~

## man

Shows the manpages for a package installed on the system.

## Mounting devices

~~~bash
mount -l # list mounted devices
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mountpoint # mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/mountpoint
umount /dev/sda1 # dismount device /dev/sda1
umount /mnt # dismount mountpoint /mnt
mount -a # mount all from fstab
umount -a # dismount all
~~~

## ping

## Kernel Modules

Kernel Modules extend or are part of the Linux Kernel. Examples:

- WiFi Driver
- Sound Card Driver
- USB Device Driver

### Displaying loaded Modules

~~~bash
# two ways to display kernel modules
kmod list
lsmod
~~~

### modinfo - Showing Module Information

~~~bash
modinfo snd # show info for snd module

~~~

### modprobe - Loading and Unloading Modules

With modprobe you can load or unload kernel modules at runtime.

~~~bash
modprobe -n MODULENAME # simulate loading a module
modprobe -a MODULENAME # load a module
modprobe -r MODULENAME # unload module
modprobe --show-depends MODULENAME # show dependencies  of a module
~~~

### depmod - Module Dependencies

depmod can be used to recreate the file **/lib/modules/KERNELVERSION/modules.dep** when adding custom modules to the kernel.

### Loading modules automatically

To load a module automatically, just add it's name to **/etc/modules**

### Blacklisting

You can disallow a module to be loaded automatically by using a blacklist. You can find the blacklist under **/etc/modprobe.d**, normally inside the file **blacklist.conf**.

## Regular Expressions

~~~bash
. # matches a single character
\ # escape character
.* # matches any string
$ # end of a line
[] # range
| # logical OR
[^] # logical NOT
~~~

## Wildcards

~~~bash
? # single character
* # any number of characters
[a-c] # range of characters
